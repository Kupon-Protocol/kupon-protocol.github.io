Title: Kupon Protocol - Coupons and Vouchers as NFTs
Date: 2021-12-18 10:20

Kupon Protocol enables NFTs to be used as coupons or vouchers for various services and products.

Here are some potential use cases:

- A company can create a limited supply NFT that represents a 20% discount coupon for a specific product.
- An influencer can offer paid NFTs that allow each holder to schedule a 30-min video chat with the influencer.
- A tutor can issue paid NFTs that represent tutoring time slots.

### Why would I want to use NFTs through the Kupon Protocol?

Because Kupon Protocol enhances its NFTs with a management system. Through this system, an NFT holder can claim the offer that the NFT holds.

Once the NFT issuer delivers the offer, they can mark the claim as complete.

### What if the NFT holder and issuer have a dispute on whether the offer was fulfilled?

The dispute resolution system would take care of resolving any disputes between an NFT holder and the NFT issuer.

### Which cryptocurrencies can be used for minting an NFT?

Initially just the native chain token, but later own NFT issuers will be able to choose any cryptocurrency they want, as long as it is present on the chain they use.

### Is there a demo I can try out?

A simple demo (Kupon v1) has been built for a recent hackathon. You can see it here: [https://app.kupon.network/](https://app.kupon.network/).

You can use it on either the Mumbai testnet (Polygon's testnet) or on the Ropsten testnet. If you'll use Mumbai, get some free testnet MATIC tokens here: [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/). 

### How can I contribute to Kupon?

No matter what skills you have you can join the Kupon Protocol community and be an active member if you want. You can either help with design, development, marketing, community building, or just provide feedback and ideas on the protocol itself.
